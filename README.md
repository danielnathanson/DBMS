# DMBS_Demo
This repo contains a video demo of the DBMS that I made.

I implemented the following:

- B+ trees
- joins
- sorting
- query optimization
- concurrency
- recovery

This was a class project of mine where I implemented all of the above functionality on top of an existing basic DBMS. Unfortunately, I cannot show the code that I wrote in this public repository because future students might find and copy it.
