# DBMS
This repository contains a video demo of the relational DBMS that I made.

I implemented the following:

- B+ trees
- joins
- sorting
- query optimization
- concurrency
- recovery

This was a class project of mine where I implemented the above functionalities on top of a provided bare-bones DBMS. Unfortunately, I cannot show the code that I wrote in this public repository because future students might come across this repository.
